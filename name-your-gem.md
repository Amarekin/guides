Here is our recommendation on how to name gems:

Use underscores
---------------

* [fancy_require](https://rubygems.org/gems/fancy_require)
* [newrelic_rpm](https://rubygems.org/gems/newrelic_rpm)
* [ruby_parser](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby_parser)

This matches the file the user will require and makes it easier for the user to
start using your gem.  `gem install my_gem` will be loaded by `require
'my_gem'`.

Use dashes for extensions
-------------------------

* [net-http-persistent](https://rubygems.org/gems/net-http-persistent)
* [rdoc-data](https://rubygems.org/gems/rdoc-data)
* [autotest-growl](https://rubygems.org/gems/autotest-growl)

If you're adding functionality to another gem use a dash.  The dash is
different-enough from an underscore to be noticeable.  If you tilt the dash a
bit it becomes a slash as well, making it easier for the user to know what to
require.  `gem install net-http-persistent` becomes
`require 'net/http/persistent'`

Don't use UPPERCASE letters
---------------------------

OS X and Windows have case-insensitive filesystems by default.  Users may
mistakenly require files from a gem using uppercase letters which will be
non-portable if they move it to a non-windows or OS X system.  While this will
mostly be a newbie mistake we don't need to be confusing them more than
necessary.
