General
-------

Installing a gem allows that gem's code to run in the context of your
application. Clearly this has security implications: installing a malicious gem
on a server could ultimately result in that server being completely penetrated
by the gem's author. Because of this, the security of gem code is a topic of
active discussion within the Ruby community.

RubyGems has had the ability to [cryptographically sign
gems](http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/rubygems-update/Gem/Security.html) since version 0.8.11. This
signing works by using the `gem cert` command to create a key pair, and then
packaging signing data inside the gem itself. The `gem install` command
optionally lets you set a security policy, and you can verify the signing key
for a gem before you install it.

However, this method of securing gems is not widely used. It requires a number
of manual steps on the part of the developer, and there is no well-established
chain of trust for gem signing keys. Discussion of new signing models using
X509 or OpenPGP is going on in the [rubygems-trust
wiki](https://github.com/rubygems-trust/rubygems.org/wiki/_pages) and
in [IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#rubygems-trust). The goal is to improve (or
replace) the signing system so that it is easy for authors and transparent for
users.

Using Gems
-------

* Install with a security profile.
  * All dependent gems must be signed and verified: `gem install gemname -P HighSecurity`
  * All signed dependent gems must be verified: `gem install gemname -P MediumSecurity`
  * With [bundler, use the `--trust-policy` flag](http://blog.meldium.com/home/2013/3/3/signed-rubygems-part), e.g. `bundle --trust-policy MediumSecurity`
* Risks of being pwned, as described by [Benjamin Smith](http://lanyrd.com/profile/benjamin_smith/)

Building Gems
-------

* gem cert
