If you found a bug that you want to fix or have an idea you'd like to contribute, you can grab your own copy of the source on [github][0]. We use github for both pull requests and [issues][1].

If you're unsure that what you found is a bug or a suitable feature addition, feel free to file [an issue][1] or ask us via [our support system][2].

### Recommendations

+ New features should be coupled with tests.
+ Ensure that your code blends well with ours (eg, no training whitespace, match indentation and coding style).
+ Don't modify the history file or version number.
+ If you have any questions, just ask us on IRC or file [an issue][1].
